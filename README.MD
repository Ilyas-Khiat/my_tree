# Client Folder Overview

This document provides an overview of the `client` folder, summarizing its structure, key components, and functionalities. The `client` folder is part of a larger project, typically housing the frontend codebase, which interacts with a backend server to fetch, display, and manipulate data.

## Getting Started

To get the frontend application running:

1. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `client` folder in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
5. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser to view the application.


# Backend Folder Overview

This document provides an overview of the `serveur` folder, summarizing its structure, key components, and functionalities. The `serveur` folder contains the server-side codebase, responsible for handling requests from the frontend, processing data, and interacting with databases or other services.

## Structure

The `backend` folder is organized into several key directories and files, each serving a specific role in the development of the backend application. Here's a brief overview:

- `models/`: Houses the data models for the application, typically interacting with a database.
- `routes/`: Defines the API endpoints and associates them with specific controller functions.
- `server.js`: The main entry point for the backend application, setting up the server and middleware.

## Getting Started

To get the backend application up and running:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and a database (as per your project's requirements) installed.
2. Navigate to the `serveur` folder in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Start the server with `npm run dev`.
5. The server should now be running and accessible for API requests.

## Team Contributions

The development of this project was a collaborative effort between team members, with responsibilities divided across both the frontend and backend to ensure a comprehensive and efficient development process. Below is an overview of the contributions made by each team member across the entire project:

### Frontend Contributions

- **EL MOSTAPHA MOUKRIM**: Focused on the design and implementation of the user interface, creating reusable components and ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.
- **ILYAS KHIAT**: Worked on state management and data fetching logic, implementing custom hooks for shared logic across components and services in for interacting with the backend API.

### Backend Contributions

- **YASSINE OULED EL BAKRI**:Led the server setup and environment configuration, Developed the API endpoints for Authentification, defining the logic for handling requests and responses, and integrated middleware for authentication and error handling.
- **ILYAS KHIAT**: Developed the API endpoints for the tree model.

## Collaboration Tools

The team utilized Git for version control, with a shared repository on GitHub to facilitate code reviews, manage contributions, and track issues. Communication and task management were handled through Slack and Trello, ensuring that the team remained aligned on goals and deadlines.
